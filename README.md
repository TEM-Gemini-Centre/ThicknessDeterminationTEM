# ThicknessDeterminationTEM
Thickness determination on the basis of Kelly et al. ( https://doi.org/10.1002/pssa.2210310251). The default parameters are for aluminum (220) and 200 kV. The setup with a GUI allows, however, to change this easily to other parameters or material systems.


Latest version V3.




# Plans for next version:
- Comparison with simulations
- written in "OOP"
- Material's library
- saving output
